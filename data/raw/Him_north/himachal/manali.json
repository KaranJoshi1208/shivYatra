    "Understand": "Manali, at the northern end of the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, is a hill station at a height of 2,050 m (6,398 ft) in the Himalayas, on the Beas River (Vyaas in Hindi) and near its source. It is a popular tourist spot for Indians in summer and a magical, snow-covered place in winter.",

Privately owned Volvo buses offer 60% cheaper ticket prices than the government owned Volvo buses. The approximate travel time from Delhi to Manali is 14 hours; from Ambala to Manali is 10 hours; and from Kulu to Manali is 1½ to 3 hours. Volvo buses—which depart at around 5PM and reach at 9-10AM next day—are available from Delhi and is the best option in terms of comfort and value for money to reach Manali but you need to book these in advance. Some hotels will book your Volvo with WiFi connection and personal LED screen along with their hotel package.",
    "By private taxi": "If hiring a private taxi, ensure that the driver has experience driving in hilly regions and does not have the habit of drinking alcohol. Also make sure the driver has done the trip at least once before and knows all roads.  Also make sure that the driver is used to drive for long hours. Many operators turn off air-conditioning during the majority of the hill journey, or demand to be paid extra if asked to. Best to confirm this prior to booking. If you are going to Manali through Chandigarh-Ropar-Kiratpur-Bilaspur-Mandi-Kullu highway, then your driver would need to drive on hilly roads for at least 6 hours. The expected price is somewhere around ₹3000 to ₹4000/day for an Indica hatchback or a bigger Innova car from Delhi. To get the best deals on cabs, look for cabs that came one-way from Manali/Kullu to drop tourists at Delhi. These cabs (usually with HP01K registration plates) offer 60% cheaper fares, as they've been paid fully by the previous customer. Also, you can find them at parking station near Majnu ka tilla/ New Aruna Nagar.",
    "By train": "The nearest Broad Gauge Rail Head is Chandigarh (310 km). Ambala Cantonment en route Chandigarh is on the Delhi - Amritsar and Delhi - Jammu main lines and is well-served by rail, but you will need to travel to Ambala to get a bus for the 10 hour ride to Manali. Jogindernagar and Kalka are other, less preferable, rail heads for Manali.\nThe nearest Broad gauge station is Kiratpur Sahib in Punjab near the city of Nangal. It lies in Ropar district of Punjab. The station lies on the Ambala Cantt - Una route of Indian Railways. From here you can easily get buses for Manali.",
    "By plane": "The nearest airport is Bhuntar (Kullu) Airport (KUU IATA); Tel: +91 1902–265037, 265603), 50 km from Manali, 10 km from Kullu, about one hour away. Air-India has a morning flight from Delhi operated by Alliance Air.\nDelhi is the nearest international airport, 560 km away from Manali. That airport is well connected to major cities in India as well as cities abroad.",
    "Get around": "There are various ways of getting around in Manali, if you are not already travelling with your own vehicle. Most tourists  hire a taxi (various kinds available), which takes you around to all the sightseeing spots in and around  Manali (Rohtang, Manikaran, etc.) It costs about ₹1800 per day, or a little over ₹3000 if you book together for 3 days (in the peak season). Dress for Rohtang costs around ₹150 for each set including boots and the ski set will cost you around ₹200. These details are mentioned on a board at Mall Road. Be sure to bargain.\nThe second most common way is to hire a motorbike. There are many places where you can hire a motorbike (easy to find if you ask around) and is the most common mode of transport for foreigners. Cruiser bikes like Bullet, Royal Enfield Himalayan, and sport bikes from Honda, Bajaj, and Yamaha, are easily available, though Bullet is the most commonly seen one on the roads. Rates hover around ₹800-1500 per day in the peak season, but are much discounted at other times. A good place worth a look will be in Bike Rentals Manali office in Vashisht 9816044140, have a good selection of Royal Enfields and Pulsars. Also 'Tinku' Bike Mechanic near old Manali Bridge is an honest shop for bike rentals.\nPublic transport is not so good. There are cheap bus services, but they are not so frequent. Yet, if you are going to stay for a long time, it is better to know the times and use them, as other modes of public transport and exorbitant compared to the bus. For e.g., auto rickshaws take ₹200 from Manali Mall Road to Solang Valley, while the bus will cost you just ₹10. The buses are not punctual especially because they seem not have a written schedule. The best option is to ask about timing at the bus terminal. Buses start to run at 7-8 AM. Frequently a bus can be cancelled or late. You can get in and out almost at any place on the route; just wave at the driver.\nPublic bus routes\n\nKullu - Manali. Price ₹60. Every 15 min\nManali - Naggar. Every 1½ hr\nManali - Solang. Every hour",
    "See": "There are several beautiful places that you can visit  around Manali. You can either use your own vehicle or hire local taxes.

Beas Kund, the source of river Beas, is also nearby. In winter, the road of Rothang Pass is closed.The road to Rohtang Pass is closed at Manali bridge on all Tuesdays between 9AM-6PM for carrying out road widening work & repairs. If you are able to leave early, before 09:00, you can avoid the traffic rush (found on all other days) and have Rohtang Pass to yourself (well almost!). Flip side is to be prepared for stoppages (extending up to a few hours) on the return trip as the road is blocked off where repair works are progressed.If you are driving up, be prepared for the rough broken roads at many places, sheer blind turns and tight hairpin bends, which can be exhilarating depending on the state of your nerves.If you are hiring a vehicle then better rent a four wheel drive vehicle from Manali. Some times the local people along with police does not allow the non-four wheel drive vehicles from going beyond Snow-Point (a place 16 km before Rohtang Pass) and force to hire their owned 4WD vehicles at exorbitant prices which can be up to ₹2000 per person.

    "Stay safe": "Manali is a safe city but during seasonal time a surge of visitors keep visiting this beautiful place and some transients exploit this opportunity for their own benefits. Best be exercise caution if in a crowd.\nIf you get lost and don't have enough directions get around the city then just ask for Mall Road (Manali town centre). From there you can easily head to any destination of your choice.\nDon't exchange currency in illegal market. Always ask for receipt after doing currency trade with exchange dealer. There is a Western Union office on the Mall Road.\nA word of caution about paragliding in Manali. Many pilots of these parachutes are un-trained and obtain licences in the usual way any licence is obtained in India. Many a tourist visits the Lady Willingdon Mission Hospital with broken bones, sometimes protruding out, after accidents. Some para-gliders crash into innocent bystanders who end up with spinal injuries and paralysis. Serious, complicated cases with multiple organ injuries and heavy blood loss are stabilized to the extent possible and referred to either Chandigarh or Shimla. Sadly, some don't make it. Blood availability is very very limited in this hilly area. So think very carefully before deciding to paraglide in Manali.\nWomen should avoid going into small lanes and by-lanes after it is dark and make sure that you are not wearing any jewellery while walking on the streets. There were two reported rapes of tourists in 2018 alone.",
