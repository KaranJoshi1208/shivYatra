    "Introduction": "Almora is a hill station in Uttarakhand State. \nThe town is typical of crowded hill towns in northern India, but the natural beauty around it is astounding. Almora is called a town of temples. Situated in the centre of the town is the temple of Goddess Nanda Devi. The mountain is also visible from the nearby areas.",
    "Understand": "Almora is a town of about 36,000 (2011) in the Kumaon mountains of the Himalayas in eastern Uttarakhand. Most of the town sits on a crescent-shaped mountain ridge about 5 km long, and most of it is above 1,800 m. The rivers Kosi and Suyal flow around Almora providing a natural barrier. Unlike Shimla, Ranikhet and Nainital, which were developed by the English, Almora is a hill station totally developed by the Kumaoni Indians.\nAlmora is an agricultural base and also a trade centre.",
    "History": "Almora was the seat of power of the Chand Dynasty who ruled the land of Kumaon for almost one thousand years. An interesting fact about the discovery of Almora is that unlike other hill stations, it was not discovered and developed by the British. The Katyuri Dynasty ruled the region around Almora from the 9th century AD, till it made way for the Chand dynasty. Raja Balo Kalyan Chand made Almora as his new capital in 1560 AD, when he transferred his capital from Champawat to Almora. The Chands occupied Almora till the 19th century AD.\nThere is an interesting local legend about the discovery of Almora. Raja Kalyan Chand, the ruler of the Chand Dynasty was riding on the horseshoe shaped ridge in the pursuit of a prey. The hunted quarry protected its life by taking refuge behind the thick bushes of Kilmora, a local wild barberry bush, and revealed the place to the king. The story might not be corroborated by any literary or archaeological evidences but continues to be told by the locals. The Gorkhas captured Almora in 1790 AD and finally British took it over from the Gorkhas after the Gorkha wars of 1814-1815.\nJawaharlal Nehru served a term of imprisonment in the jail at Almora during the British rule. He left behind an elaborate account of the pleasures of solitude and the varied moods of nature in his various letters written from this place to his daughter.",
