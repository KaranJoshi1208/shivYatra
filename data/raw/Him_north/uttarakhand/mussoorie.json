    "Introduction": "Mussoorie is a hill station in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. With its green hills and varied flora and fauna, Mussoorie is a fascinating hill resort and a fabulous honeymoon spot. Commanding a wonderful view of extensive Himalayan snow ranges to the northeast and glittering views of the Doon Valley, Roorkee, Saharanpur and Haridwar to the South, the town presents a fairyland atmosphere to tourists.",
    "Understand": "Its history dates back to 1827 when Captain Young, an adventurous military officer, explored the site and laid the foundation of this holiday town.",
    "Climate": "At an altitude of over 2,000 m (6,600 ft), Mussoorie is a popular retreat from the heat of the plains. In winter (Dec-Feb) you can expect freezing weather and snow. The monsoon arrives in July and stays through to mid-September.",
    "Tourist information": "Mussoorie on Uttarakhand Tourism website",
    "By bus": "Buses leave from Dehradun train station.  There are two buses which go to opposite ends of the Mussoorie Mall, Library and Picture Palace. It is quite a hike from one to the other, so make sure you catch the right one.\nTo reach Kempty Falls directly from Dehradun catch a bus from the Dehradun Railway station Hill Bus Services Section or take a taxi. You should look for buses heading for destinations like Barkot, Nainbagh, Yamunotri, and Purola (sometimes Purola buses go via Vikas nagar which may take you off the route completely).\nYou can also take a bus to the Library end of Mussoorie and walk to the Kempty Bus stop and take a bus or taxi or a milkvan or hitch a ride with a tourist going in that direction. Bus fee for Library end or Kulri end (from Dehradun) is ₹47.\nToll Tax is payable on entering Kempty Village per bus/taxi/car/scooter. Bus fare from library end to Kempty is around ₹15.",
    "By taxi": "Taxis are not a useful form of transport within Mussoorie. If you are heading up to Landour with luggage, it would be wise to catch a ride. They can also be hired for outings to places such as Kempty Falls or Happy Valley. \nThere are taxi stands at both ends of the Mall. Many locals offer 'taxi' services, and if you are staying longer you will likely find these (slightly cheaper) alternatives. But all the taxis are under a union, so the rates do not vary. One has to hire them through one of the union offices at library end, mall road, Kempty bus stand etc.\nYou can also rent a private car, which will cost more but less time-consuming. A complete day of sightseeing around the city by taxi including Dhanoltri and Kempty Falls costs around ₹1800.",
    "Get around": "Once in Mussoorie, the affordable and effective way to get around the city by bus or cycle rickshaws. Cycle rickshaws for traveling within city may cost approximately ₹20. However, it may get crowded, especially during peak hours. For the most part, you will want to get around on foot. The Mall is closed to most vehicles.",
    "By rickshaw": "A relatively flat section of the Mall allows a fleet of rickshaws to ply their trade. You can catch a ride from the Library end of the Mall to about the midpoint. A full day of Mussoorie sightseeing by rickshaw is cheaper than private cabs and taxis, albeit time-consuming.",
